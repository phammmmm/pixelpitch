        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>Pixel Pitch started with the concept to provide high quality material for custom t-shirts as seamlessly as possible.
          Along the way, we also got rid of the usual minimum quantity requirement and limited color restrictions that is still the norm in 2019.
          We made designing custom t-shirts so easy and unique. Our slogan is “Everyone is super model” so we create the huge range of t-shirts
          that represent your characteristics and bring the best experiences to our customers.
          Singapore based and owned, we are committed to fast turnaround times without compromising on quality.
          Sweatshop free and child labor free!</p><br /><br /><br />

        <h2>Shop For A Good Cause</h2>
        <p> We are friends of charitable endeavours, and we donate to acknowledged charitable organizations.
          This is how we can harness the potential we have as a continuously growing company to support values and things close to our heart.
          And we never condition our donations on purchases made with our company.
          We do, however, grant concessionary terms to recognized organizations using print-on-demand apparel to point to social injustices.</p>
